/*
# Restore secure public deal visibility

1. Purpose
- Reuse the existing `designer_deals` table for the public Offers & Deals pages.
- Keep the existing administrator and designer management workflows working.
- Make publication and date eligibility enforceable by Supabase RLS rather than relying only on frontend filters.

2. Existing table used
- `designer_deals` is unchanged.
- No tables, columns, records, prices, images or relationships are created, removed or modified.

3. Security changes
- Public anonymous and signed-in visitors can read only active deals whose validity window includes the current time.
- Active administrators can read, create, update and delete all deals.
- A designer can read and manage only deals linked to that designer's own profile.
- Update checks validate both the row being edited and the new designer association.
- Separate policies are used for each CRUD operation.

4. Important notes
- Existing deal records are preserved.
- Existing admin and designer policies are replaced with equivalent, explicit CRUD policies to remove policy drift and avoid broad `FOR ALL` grants.
- Redemption records remain private and are not made publicly readable.
